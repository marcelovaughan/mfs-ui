There are many resources we can leverage for this: the developer survey answers, GitHub issue upvotes, Algolia search volume, Google search volume, documentation usage, npm downloads, etc.\\n  - Prioritize the creation of frequently needed components.\\n  - Encourage the usage of third-party components if they already exist and are well maintained.\\n  - Offer an option to the highly used and well maintained components to move to the official organization: mui-org/x on GitHub, @material-ui/x on npm and x.material-ui.com for the documentation.\\n- 0.5 - **Better customization.** \\ud83d\\udc85 We want to make our component customization intuitive, no matter if you are using global CSS or styled-components:\\n  - Use styled-components by default: [#6115](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/6115).\\n  - Allow the use of the Box props in all the core components: [#15561](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/15561).\\n  - Allow the usage of dynamic theme variants and colors: [#15573](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/15573) & [#13875](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/13875).\\n  - Allow the use of the components without any styles: [#6218](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/6218).\\n  - Improve the support of custom breakpoints: [#11649](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/11649)\\n  - Explore the integration with theme-specification, by @jxnblk.\\n- 0.3 - **Better documentation.** \\ud83d\\udcda This is a broad topic. The focus is on the following areas:\\n  - Page documentation rating \\ud83e\\udd47\\ud83e\\udd48\\ud83e\\udd49. We will integrate a rating module in all our documentation pages. This way, we can collect high-quality data points and prioritize the pages that need the most to be improved.\\n  - Templates. They get people started really quickly, we need more of them!\\n  - Beginner tutorials & Video lessons.\\n- 0.3 - **TypeScript.** \\ud83d\\udccf There are two dimensions to this problem:\\n  - The documentation. We want to provide a TypeScript variant of most of our demos.\\n    You can help us out in [#14897](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/14897), we have already covered +90% of them.\\n  - The definitions. We are **continuously** improving them. For instance, we are working on moving the props descriptions to TypeScript, so you can access them directly from your IDE.\\n    The codebase is written in JavaScript, we don't plan on migrating it to TypeScript in the near future. Upvote [#15984](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/15984) if you want us to rewrite the core in a future version.\\n- 0.3 - **Performance.** \\ud83d\\ude80 React abstraction has a cost. The more components you render, the slower your page will be. You will notice stark differences when rendering a large table or list.\\n  Performance is all about doing less work. We can leverage the following:\\n  - Make the core faster.\\n  - Avoid re-rendering. It's the responsibility of the user to prune the React rendering tree efficiently,\\n    as most of our APIs are too low level to implement efficient memoization (React.useMemo, React.memo).\\n    If you find a good opportunity for it, let us know, and we will be happy to work with you on the problem.\\n  - Avoid rendering. We have documented [how to implement virtualization](/components/tables/#virtualized-table) for the Table components. It's important to consider it above 100 items.\\n- 0.2 - **Bundle size.** \\ud83d\\udce6 You can keep track of our progress [following bundlephobia.com report](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@material-ui/core).\\n  It's a continuous effort \\u2013 v4 was [18% smaller](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@material-ui/core@3.9.2) than v3, while adding new features.\\n  We are eager to find new bundle size reduction opportunities. We hope we can leverage these two in the future:\\n  - A JSS to styled-component migration should help. Compare [JSS v10.0.0-alpha.24](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-jss@10.0.0-alpha.24) with [styled-components v5.0.0-beta.8](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=styled-components@5.0.0-beta.8). We could save ~6 kB gzipped.\\n  - Popper.js is working [on a smaller v2](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=popper.js@2.0.0-next.4) version. We could save ~4 kB gzipped.\\n- 0.2 - **Accessibility.** \\u267f\\ufe0f We have relatively [few accessibility issues](https://darekkay.com/blog/accessible-ui-frameworks/), but we are eager to address them all. We would appreciate the help of accessibility experts.\\n- 0.2 - **Material Design Update.** \\ud83c\\udf80 We are relatively up-to-date but the material design specification [is evolving](https://material.io/whats-new/), so should we.\\n\\n## New components\\n\\nHere are the components we will work on being supported in the Material-UI ecosystem, no matter if they are from @material-ui/core, a third-party project or a paid source:\\n\\n- \\ud83e\\uddea In the lab, in progress to move into the core\\n- \\ud83d\\udee0 Work in progress, will likely land in the lab\\n- \\u23f3 Planning to build\\n- \\u2b50\\ufe0f We will consider making some of the features paid (non MIT)\\n\\n| Name                    | Status |\\n| ----------------------- | ------ |\\n| Rating                  | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Skeleton                | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Speed Dial              | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Toggle Button           | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Tree View               | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Autocomplete            | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Combo Box               | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Multiselect             | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Alert                   | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Pagination              | \\ud83e\\uddea     |\\n| Date Picker (& range)   | \\ud83d\\udee0      |\\n| Data Table              | \\ud83d\\udee0\\u2b50\\ufe0f   |\\n| Carousel                | \\u23f3     |\\n| Dropdown                | \\u23f3     |\\n| Dropzone                | \\u23f3     |\\n| File Upload             | \\u23f3     |\\n| Image                   | \\u23f3     |\\n| Navbar                  | \\u23f3     |\\n| Nested Menu             | \\u23f3     |\\n| Numeric Input           | \\u23f3     |\\n| Scrollspy               | \\u23f3     |\\n| TopLayout               | \\u23f3     |\\n| Big Calendar            | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Charts                  | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Sparkline               | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Color Picker            | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Gantt Chart             | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Gauge                   | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Masonry                 | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Pivot Grid              | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Rich Text Editor        | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Scheduler               | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Splitter                | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Tree View - Checkbox    | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| Tree View - Drag & Drop | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n| TreeSelect              | \\u23f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f  |\\n\\n> \\u26a0\\ufe0f **Disclaimer**: We operate in a dynamic environment, and things are subject to change.
